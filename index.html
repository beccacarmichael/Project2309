            <h2>Overview</h2> 
            <p class="project-page methodology" >Kawartha Conservation, located in Ontario Canada, is one of 36 conservation authorities operating 
                in Ontario and a member of Conservation Ontario. As a part of doing their duty to ensure the ongoing 
                health of the watershed they developed a 10-year Environmental Monitoring Strategy which included 
                many recommendations some of which are centered around data reporting and sharing to encourage 
                public interaction and understanding of the vital information Kawartha Conservation collects 
                throughout the watershed. To achieve these recommendations Kawartha Conservation partnered with 
                LYB Consulting and the Immersive Insights Into Nature: Environmental Monitoring Dashboards 
                project was developed.  </p> 
                <p class="project-page methodology" >Our team has worked to develop several resources Kawartha Conservation can utilize to achieve 
                    these data sharing recommendations for three of their Environmental Programs: Biomonitoring, 
                    Water Temperature Monitoring, and Water Quality Monitoring. We have created individual Dashboards 
                    for each Environmental Program as well as a StoryMap housing those Dashboards.  Kawartha 
                    Conservation will add these to their public facing website, allowing the public to interact with 
                    the data and observe the findings of each Environmental Program in an immersive way. During the 
                    creation of this project the team also insured the data could be updated frequently by the client 
                    through an automated process in order to efficiently keep the data presented up to date.</p>
