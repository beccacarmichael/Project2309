        <h2>About The Project</h2> <!-- ####CHANGE-->
        <p>As a part of their duty to ensure the ongoing health of the watershed, the Integrated 
          Watershed Management department conducted a review of the Environmental Programs currently 
          in operation which lead to the development of a 10-year Environmental Monitoring Strategy 
          beginning in 2022. This Strategy outlined many recommendations including; to report data 
          regularly, to track land use changes and to establish a data sharing platform which is the 
          stepping-stone for this project.</p> <!-- ####CHANGE-->
        <p>The goal of the Immersive Insights Into Nature project is to create interactive Dashboards 
          for select Environmental Programs aimed at achieving those recommendations. </p> <!-- ####CHANGE-->
        <p>The project goal was achieved by creating several public-facing web solutions that 
          tell a story about the 3 selected Environmental Monitoring Programs 
          	Biomonitoring 
          	Temperature monitoring 
          	And water quality monitoring  </p> <!-- ####CHANGE-->
        <p>Upon project completion, these solutions will be utilized on Kawartha Conservation’s 
          corporate website to display UpToDate data and findings about the watershed. Allowing 
          public interaction and utilization and the ongoing success of the Environmental Monitoring 
          Strategy.</p>
