                    to be utilized by Kawartha Conservation on their public facing website allowing meaningful and 
                    impactful public interaction and engagement with the data collected by three Environmental 
                    Programs; Biomonitoring, Water Temperature Monitoring and Water Quality.

                    interactive Dashboards which feature data Kawartha Conservation has collected related to 
                    these programs.  The Dashboards present this data along with background information and visual

                    <h2>Biomonitoring Dashboard</h2> 
                    <p class="project-page methodology" >The Biomonitoring Dashboard was created to show the trends of 
                        Family Biotic Index and Sensitive Organisms for site locations throughout the watershed. The 
                        Dashboard features two scatter plots showing the trends of each monitoring site over the years. 
                        The graphs are shaded showing different thresholds of the data collected. The Dashboard can be 
                        filtered by Site Type or Habitat Type so the user can see specific trends throughout the watershed. 
                        Alternatively, the user can choose to view the data for a specific year or site.

                    <h3> Water Temperature Dashboard</h3>
                    <p class="project-page methodology">The Water Temperature Dashboard was created to show data collected 
                        monthly at sample sites across the Kawartha Watershed and the percent of each month where the 
                        recorded water temperature was less than the favorable water temperature for Brook Trout habitat 
                        (22Â°C). The user can populate the data collected at individual sites throughout the watershed by 
                        using the selector within the Dashboard. Upon site selection the data is presented to the user 
                        both in graph and tabular format, allowing them to interact with the data in a variety of ways.

                        Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network data. Following the prompt, the user selects a category, 
                        year and individual site location which populates average concentration charts as well as a pass/fail 
                        chart for all sites for that category threshold in the selected year.
