                    allow the public to interact and engage with the data collected by the selected Monitoring 
                    Programs in a meaningful and impactful way. The StoryMap provides the user with both background 
                    information and an understanding of the programs and their importance to watershed management. 
                    Embedded within the StoryMap are three interactive Esri Dashboards which feature data 
                    Kawartha Conservation has collected related to these programs which, along with the background 
                    information provides the public with a visual aid to understand and interpret the data being presented.

                    <h2>Biomonitoring Dashboard</h2> 
                    <p class="project-page methodology" >The Biomonitoring Dashboard was created to show 
                        the trends of Family Biotic Index and Sensitive Organisms for monitoring sites, using 
                        a dataset with a date range from 2005 to 2023. The following figures show the Dashboard 
                        when there is no site selected and again with a site selected. The scatter plots connected
                            with lines show the trends of each monitoring site over the years. Each site is classified 
                            into different colors, as shown in the legend on the right. The graphs are also shaded with 
                            different colors for different categories. In addition, when hovering over the points in
                            the graphs, the Dashboard shows the date when the site was inspected. The white circle 
                            at the top of the graph enables users to change the time frame by moving it to the left 
                            or right. When a site is selected, the site details and a picture of the site are shown.
                            The user can also filter the site by selecting different habitat type, site type and 
                            year using the selectors at the top. There's also a collapsible sidebar on the left, 
                            where the user can click on it to find the dashboard instructions.

                    <h3> Water Temperature Dashboard</h3>
                    <p class="project-page methodology">The Water Temperature Dashboard was created to show data collected monthly
                            at sample sites across the Kawartha Watershed and the percent of each month where the recorded water 
                            temperature was less the 22 °C which is the favorable water temperature for Brook Trout habitat. 
                            The user is prompted to select the site by clicking on the site selector in the upper right corner 
                            of the Dashboard when there is no selection made. Once a site is selected a series of interactive 
                            data is created. The map zooms to the corresponding site location, the Brook Trout Habitat Preference 
                            graph is populated showing the percentage of days where the water temperature was under 22 °C each 
                            month, which is preferable for Brook Trout habitat. After a site selection is made the Water Temperature 
                            Recordings graph also populates showing the minimum, average and maximum temperatures recorded each month 
                            for the corresponding Site location. Additionally, the Water Temperature and Habitat Preference Table is 
                            populated summarizing the data presented in both graphs for the given site presenting the data in a usable 
                            manner for further exploration.

                    <h3> Water Quality Dashboard</h3>   
                    <p class="project-page methodology">The Water Quality Dashboard was created to show trends in the Provincial Water Quality 
                        Monitoring Network data, using a sample dataset that spans 5 years. Each section of the Dashboard prompts the 
                        user to click on the dropdown menus on the top right to select a category and year. This bar graph shows the 
                        percentage of samples in a station that have passed/failed a given threshold for the selected category and year. 
                        A picture on the top left shows a photograph of each selected site. Since the photographs were not provided at the 
                        time of Dashboard completion, a placeholder image has been added to this section. This image can be replaced within 
                        the “Inputs” section of the PWQMN script.
