                    The workflow followed during the implementation phase of the project is shown 
                    in the figure below. A script was created that processes the data using a combination 
                    of geoprocessing tools and database rules. The processed data was then uploaded to 
                    ArcGIS Online and used to create three different Dashboards, each corresponding to an 
                    environmental monitoring program at Kawartha Conservation. Once the Dashboards were created
                    they were added to a StoryMap with corresponding background information. Kawartha 
                    Conservation will display this on their website, allowing the public to learn more about the Environmental
                    Programs and interact with the data collected.

                    Each Dashboard was processed to fit a particular schema. The Biomonitoring Dashboard 
                    used a conditional statement to classify wetlands into categories (excellent, good, 
                    etc.) depending on the concentrations of specific species of aquatic invertebrates. 
                    The Temperature Monitoring script queried and filtered out specific attributes. 
                    The PWQMN dataset was cleared of any errors that would cause issues when displayed 
                    on the Dashboard. Once the pre-processing was complete, the data was placed in a 
                    geodatabase, where specific database rules were applied.

                <p class="Project-page methodology">
                    The client provided sample data along with a clear schema. The raw data was stored 
                    in an Excel file for automation and then loaded into a geodatabase. To improve data 
                    integrity, database rules were established based on the client's requirements. 
                </p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology">
                    First, all fields were given proper field names that are easy to understand, 
                    along with the proper data type. In order to add an attribute rule to the dataset, 
                    the GlobalIDs were generated first. Domains were also created to constrain the 
                    available values in the attributes for a table or feature class. For example, the 
                    Family Biotic Index by Category of the Biomonitoring Dashboard has the domain 
                    consisting of "Excellent", "Good", "Poor", "Fairly Poor" and "Very Poor". 
                    Calculation attribute rules were created to automate the category based on 
                    the values. For example, when the Family Biotic Index Value is 6.6, the 
                    Family Biotic Index Category will return "Poor" because the range of “Poor” is 
                    from 6.51 to 7.25. Feature that fails to follow the rules will result in an error 
                    feature and a window with error messages that will pop up in ArcGIS Pro. In addition, 
                    constraint attribute rules were also created to keep the input values to be in a valid 
                    range, for example, the valid range of Family Biotic Index is from 0 to 10. If a value 
                    entered is greater than 10 or smaller than 0, it will result in an error.

                    geoprocessing tool was used to publish the web layer.

                    Once the data was uploaded to ArcGIS Online, three interactive Esri Dashboards were created; 
                    Biomonitoring, Temperature Monitoring and Water Quality. During the creation of each Dashboard, 
                    a template was created to facilitate the team in ensuring that they are meeting the client's 
                    requirements. Upon the completion of a template, the team ensured that all the visualization 
                    needs were being met in order to ensure data is being communicated effectively allowing the 
                    client to communicate to the community. The team provided the client with the necessary 
                    documentation to reproduce and create Dashboards for the other Monitoring Programs in the future. 
                </p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology"><b>1. Create Dashboard Template</b></p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology">
                    The Esri Dashboards created were a combination of a Tactical Dashboard highlighting historical 
                    data and trends for analysis and an Informational Dashboard helping the client engage the 
                    community by displaying the data in an engaging, easy to digest manner. Each Dashboard was created 
                    from a unique template which: featured the client's requirements for the Environmental Monitoring 
                    Program, told the story of that program, and communicated the information in a user friendly, 
                    intuitive platform. The Dashboards feature a combination of interactive graphs, maps and other 
                    information regarding the featured Environmental Program. Table 2 below features the three 
                    Environmental Monitoring Programs that were featured as Dashboards for this project and the 
                    client's requirements for each to display the data in a meaningful/impactful way. 
                </p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology"><b>2. Dashboard Visualization</b></p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology">
                    Once the Dashboard templates were created the required symbology was applied to each to 
                    ensure the data was displayed to fit the client's requirements and in a meaningful and 
                    impactful way. Symbology was made easy for the community and users to understand by 
                    including simple symbols that represent the attributes being displayed/ highlighted in a 
                    meaningful manner. All cartographic symbology was created using ArcGIS ensuring consistency 
                    and simplistic cartographic outputs, therefore ensuring community usability and understanding.
                </p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology"><b>3. Story Map</b></p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology">
                    After the Dashboards were created and visualized in a cohesive manner, a Story Map was 
                    created using information about each EP and its corresponding Dashboard. The Story Map was 
                    created to follow criteria outlined by the client and visualization decisions were made to 
                    ensure the data was presented clearly and in an easy-to-understand manner for the end user - 
                    the general public.  
                </p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology"><b>4. Documentation</b></p>
                <p class="Project-page methodology">
                    Upon completion of the Dashboard design, documentation of the steps involved in the creation 
                    of each Dashboard and the Story Map was delivered to the client ensuring the client can 
                    reproduce these elements in the future. This allows the replication of Dashboards for the 
                    other EPs that reflect the existing Dashboards and the update of the Story Map to fit the 
                    client's changing needs. The documentation also features any required information from the
                    script and database workflows, and notes on the cartographic outputs in order for the client 
                    to replicate these in the future.
